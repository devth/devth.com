# What is Good CI/CD?


This is an attempt to standardize my own thoughts on what makes CI/CD good or not.

Like many things in software engineering, CI/CD is made up of many simple
components and decisions, but more often than not I've been dropped into a
company where less-experienced engineers set up CI/CD to solve their immediate
problem without thinking about the wider impact of other team and system
requirements.

Some of these seem incredibly basic, but I'm documenting them because I've seen
them go wrong.

## Persistent logs

I should be able to view a PR from last month, navigate into its jobs and see
exactly what happened, including detailed logs.

## GitHub Commit Checks

CI jobs should report its status as a check directly on each commit. Not a
comment on a PR (which is composed of many commits).

## Centralized workflows

The idea of centralizing your workflows is great.

## Nearness

This one is less clear cut, but in general, if you're on GitHub (like almost
every team I've worked with) you should default to using GitHub Actions.

## Fail CI/CD if the deployment fails

Many times I've seen a CD job kick off a deployment (like helm, or porter),
which is a very asynchronous process, then continue the job, essentially
reporting whether the deployment was started successfully, but not whether it
was completed successfully.
