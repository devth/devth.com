Individual engineers are great at managing lots of complexity \*if they are the
person who originally set it up.

The problem is when the next engineer comes along and has to untangle the mess
without the benefit of having set it all up. The process of setting it all up
internalizes everything, piece by piece.

We need a word for this under-acknowledged conundrum.

It's sort of like Not Invented Here Syndrome.

Except more like:

Not Loaded Into Your Mind and Created Many Neural Connections as a Result of
Making 100s of Small Decisions and Discoveries Which Naturally Led to the
Development of a Complex Neural Network Internalizing a Complex System Over
Hours and Days and Weeks and Months.
