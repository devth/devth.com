It's hard to capture what it means for an engineering team or organization to be
dysfunctional, but any experienced engineer knows it when they see it.

As I watched a team present their work and all the challenges they were solving
to executive leadership, I couldn't help but think about how in a high
performance team, these kinds of problems don't even exist. Instead, they're
completely avoided by high performance engineering culture, whether intentional
or by accident (let's be honest - luck has a decent amount to do with it).

To help illustrate the point, here's a somewhat-ridiculous analogy that exaggerates
the problem.

## The deliverable

Let's say the team's job is to dig a rectangular hole in the ground, 30 ft by 40
ft by 10 ft deep. How should we solve the problem?

## Dynsfunctional Engineering

Ok, let's get 12 people with shovels and pickaxes. Each person can dig
approximately 6 cubic feet per hour, and we've got 12,000 cubic feet to be
displaced, so with 12 people that'll take 1000 hours to complete. If the crew
works 8 hours a day that'll take 125 days to complete. Working only weekdays,
that's 25 weeks or about 5.7 months. Let's call it half a year.

## High Performance Engineering

It's often the case that execs (and especially non-technical / non-CTO execs)
don't understand how longs thing should take, what tools are available let alone
understand the subtleties of complexity, team dynamics, tech debt, or other
constraints.
