title: "Problems compound, but so do solutions"
---

In Software we call it "Technical Debt". We've all experienced it. Technical
debt is often acreted slowly over time and can be very insidious because you
don't notice it happening until after it becomes a monstrously expensive problem
to fix.

But there's a corrollary. Let's call it Technical Credit.

Solving problems at a holistic foundatioan level lets you forget about the
problem that it solved, the capability that it provides, and creates a
foundation to build on top of. It compounds over time as you build layer upon
layer above it.

Serverless affords you the ability to forget about servers and instead focus on
product development.

Kubernetes affords you the ability to forget about many details of distributed
systems, including networking, auto scaling, resource utilization, disk
management, and much more. In Kubernetes you get to stop talking about these.
