            growing web and mobile apps. Cares about Developer Experience as
            much as User Experience. Very interested in making your life easier.

            I wield technology to build great products and experiences and
            strive toward doing exactly that at every layer of the stack:

              iterating on meticulously-detailed frontends for client sites,

            </li>
            <li>
              at the API level efficiently piping and transforming data between
              backend and frontend with considerations around concurrency, authn
              and authz

              at the very back working on a Scala-based in-memory distributed
              columnar data store for eBay which powered real-time analytics for
              seller tools
            </li>
            <li>
              as a Site Reliability Engineer creating automation, standards, and

            Strong proponent of using automation to make processes more

            Obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to
            programming problems. I abhor unsoundness, boilerplate, repetitive
            code and senseless abstraction. On a path of ongoing language
            discovery, from:

            Most of my post topics are areas I wanted to better understand, and
            writing about them was a way to achieve that. I don't claim to be an
            expert. Please give me feedback, good or bad, but especially bad. If
            you'd like to chat, I usually hang out on{" "}
