Full stack software engineer with two decades experience growing web and mobile
apps. Cares about Developer Experience as much as User Experience. Very
interested in making your life easier!

I wield technology to build great products and experiences and strive toward
doing exactly that at every layer of the stack:

- iterating on meticulously-detailed frontends for client sites, interactive
  experiences, and web applications
- at the API level efficiently piping and transforming data between backend and
  frontend with considerations around concurrency, authn and authz
- at the very back working on a Scala-based in-memory distributed columnar
  data store for eBay which powered real-time analytics for seller tools
- as a Site Reliability Engineer creating automation, standards, and
  modern container-based infrastructure in public and private clouds

Strong proponent of using automation to make processes more efficient and
repeatable. I build an open source chat bot called
[Yetibot](https://yetibot.com) for this purpose and for fun.

Obsessed with discovering better ways of expressing solutions to programming
problems. I abhor unsoundness, boilerplate, repetitive code and senseless
abstraction. On a path of ongoing language discovery, from:

- early dark ages in Perl, JavaScriptÂ¹, Lingo (wat) and VB
- middle ages in C# and ActionScript 3, Ruby and Python, Java
- up to recent years using Scala with Scalaz, Datalog (via Datomic), some Swift
- building open source with Clojure (and ClojureScript)
- grinding as necessary with Golang
- playing with Haskell, Eta, Elm
- aspiring to use (read: blow minds with ðŸ¤¯) [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/)

Part time Pure Functional Programming zealot and Category Theory student.

Most of my post topics are areas I wanted to better understand, and writing
about them was a way to achieve that. I don't claim to be an expert. Please give
me feedback, good or bad, but especially bad. If you'd like to chat, I usually
hang out on [Yetibot Slack](https://slack.yetibot.com), or you can Tweet
[@devth](https://twitter.com/devth).

I work remotely on a globally-distributed team for [Carta](https://carta.com/)
helping build the future of financial infrastructure. I live in Montana with my
wife and five kids. I'm an aspiring electronics tinkerer, musician, climber,
[mountain biker and cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/devth), learner, avid
[listener of music](https://www.last.fm/user/trevorhartman), and maker of
things.
