Planning processes can expand to fill available time

What's the maximum capacity for work in a constrained amount of time for a
Platform organization?

Factors:

- Consensus, trust, alignment
- Access, roadblocks
- Opportunity for Realtime communication
  - When I need something can I ping someone, get access or an answer in 5
    minutes, and continue my work?
  - Or at the opposite extreme: I talk to my manager, they talk to other
    managers, perhaps at a weekly leads meeting, a proposal rots for weeks,
    eng leadership outside the org gets involved, decicions are run up and down
    multiple management chains, a decision is delivered to the line manager, and
    at the next weekly (or biweekly) 1:1 the manager delivers the decision to
    the IC, but the IC disagrees and kicks off a process of pushing back via
    DMing random people, writing counter-proposals
- Ideal: Lazy load best effort

## First principles

## Status quo

## Building a bridge from here to there

As usual, I think through the lens of:

1. What is the idea state?
2. What is the current state? This takes into account legacy decisions, tech and
   people constraints, business constraints, etc.
3. How do we incrementally move from current state to the ideal state? Do we
   need to downgrade our expectations of what a realistic, achievable end state
   should be?
