This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React
component:

<TestComponent name="next-mdx-remote" />

```typescript
const a = true;
```

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using
`gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed
to `next-mdx-remote`.
