Monorepos have become popular in recent years. What problems are they solving,
and what problems are they introducing? Should we switch to monorepo?

## Monorepos introduce problems

Monorepos introduce many technical, organizational and political problems.

Monorepos are typically an alternative to standard build tooling. That means
every feature your favorite, wildly popular, community-supported build tool's
features will likely be missing in your monorepo tooling. You either need to
custom build it, or tell your users "sorry, we don't support that".

## Monorepos increase coupling

In a large company there are people, teams, services, languages, frameworks that
exist without you actually knowing about them. This is a good thing. We need
boundaries and abstractions in order to make the world smaller.

Counterpoint: Google. (Counterpoint: you are not Google).

## Single language vs multi language

There's a very big difference between monorepo tools that support multiple
languages (like Bazel) and single language monorepo tools like Turborepo, Rush,
or Lerna.

Single language tools typically have a much better developer experience and are
less complex because the language gets first class support. All the tooling is
built around that particular language, which means there's likely much less of a
gap between the full ecosystem of tooling for that language and what's available
in the constrained monorepo world.

Contrast that with a tool like Bazel. Bazel is very extensible, so even if your
language isn't already supported you can add support pretty easily. But
"support" just means opting in to the Bazel way of doing things, including
its impressive incremental builds and extreme use of caching. What you don't get
is IDE or standard tooling support. Want to use LSP and NeoVim? Too bad. The
tools are setup in a way that expect common build tooling (e.g. deps in
`node_modules` or compiled code in `target`). Bazel breaks all these
conventions, so the vast ecosystem of tools built upon them just don't work
unless you go to great lengths (and introduce incredible complexity) to bridge
the gap between Bazel-land and established standards.

## Go all in

If you're going to use a monorepo, you need to absolutely go all in. You need a
dedicated team to maintain your monorepo indefinitely. **Monorepos are an
incredibly complex and expensive endeavor** but most people don't talk about
this.

This team should be come an expert in the tooling, whether it's Bazel, Pants,
Buck, Earthly, Lerna, or something else.

The monorepo should be the de facto way of building software at your company. Do
not end up in a state where you still have polyrepos alongside your monorepo, or
worse yet: multiple monorepos. This is the path to destruction.

## Vendors as outsourced experts

Because monorepos are incredibly complex and the tooling is nowhere near on-par
with the standard tooling, whole companies have spun up around the monorepo
ecosystem. You can hire them to be your experts and help fill the missing
tooling gaps.

They are expensive, but they are probably worth it when you compare their fee to
a few annual developer salaries.

**Monorepos are very expensive.** Make sure you're all in and understand the
costs before embarking.

## So what's the point?

It's not all bad. Monorepos exist for a reason, and as long as you can avoid the
many traps, it can provide a great developer experience.

Monorepos give you:

- Atomic code changes that you can be developed, tested, reviewed, and released
  together.
- Managed tooling. The team who supports the monorepo can take care of details
  for you so you no longer need to care about them. Things like security
  patches, dependency upgrades, CI/CD pipelines, and even automatic provisioning
  of infrastructure (although these are all things you can do in a polyrepo
  too).
- A constrained set of standard langauges, frameworks, dependencies, and
  tooling.
