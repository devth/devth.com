title: Notes on Distributed Systems
---

These notes are from the excellent [Distributed Systems lecture series by
Martin
Kleppman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB).

## Introduction

A system becomes distributed when it leaves the confines of a single machine.
A single machine provides concurrency in the form of multiple cores that can do
work in parallel.

A true distributed system provides concurrency via many machines made up of one
or more cores that can do more work in parallel than can fit on a single
machine.

Obligatory Leslie Lamport quote:

> A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even
> know existed can render your own computer unusable

Kleppman's definition is a little more concrete:

1. Multiple computers communicating via a network
2. Trying to achieve some tasks together
3. Consisting of "nodes" (computer, phone, car, robot, ...)

### Why make a distributed system?

1. It's inherently distributed, e.g. sending a message from one device to
   another)
2. For better reliability: even if one node fails, the system as a whole keeps
   functioning.
3. For better performance: get data from a nearby node rather than one halfway
   round the world.
4. To solve bigger problems, e.g. processing data too large to fit on a single
   machine.

### What are the disadvantages of distributed systems?

1. Communication between nodes may fail (and we might not even know it).
2. Processes may crash (and we might not know it).
3. Distributed systems introduce higher levels of non-determinism and are
   therefore harder to reason about.

When building distributed systems we strive for fault tolerance: we want the
system as a whole to continue working, even when some parts are faulty, but this
is hard.

## Computer networking

### Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Split app into multiple services that communicate via some RPC, often with some
Interface Definition Language (IDL) like Protobuf (used by gRPC), GraphQL Schema
Definition, or Apache Thrift.

## The two generals problem

There are two armies, each controlled by 1 general. They must work together in
order to capture a city. If only 1 of them attacks, they will lose. If both
attack at the same time then they will win.

1. The generals can't communicate to coordinate their attack.

## 5. Replication

Replication is keeping a copy of the same data on multiple nodes.

Replicas provide redundancy in the case where a node goes down (caused by any
number of reasons including network partition, power loss, corrupt hardware,
and human error).

## Spanner

Consistency

Distributed Transaction across all nodes
Atomic commit - made on all nodes or aborted on all of the nodes

State machine replication (Paxos, similar to Raft) within a shard

Serializable transaction locking - two phase
Hold locks until the transaction commits

### Consistency

- Serializable transactions
- Linearizable reads and writes
- Replication across many shards with atomic commits of transactions across them

### Atomicity

Two phase commit for cross-shard atomicity

### Spanner

Read only transactions without locks.
From a "consistent snapshot" - a view of the database at a specific point in
time using timestamps.

### Multi Version Concurrency Control

Common technique used by databases (Postgres, MySQL).

It attaches a timestamp to every transaction.

During a transaction it makes a copy of the object being written to with the new
timestamp on it. Then if a read happens at the previous timestamp during the
write it retrieves data from the older version - it ignores versions with a
timestamp greater than the read timestamp.

Physical clocks don't guarantee perfect timestamps. So why not logical clocks or
lamport clocks?

Replicas may never communicate with eachother, so nothing propagates lamport
timestamps from A to B. We can't rely on the user to coordinate these.

Replica B may not realize it needs a higher timestamp for T2 than T1 on Replica
A.

We can use physical clocks but they must be adjusted to maintain causal
ordering. Spanner does this using a system of physical clocks called TrueTime.

Replica requests a timestamp and it gets a range of min and max times.
We can't be certain about absolute real time, but we can track the errors in the
system including round-trip-time and drift to compute an uncertainty interval.
